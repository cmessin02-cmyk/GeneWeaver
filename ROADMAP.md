# GeneWeaver Roadmap
### Research-Stage Computational Genomics Framework

---

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the planned development, experimental modules, and conceptual expansions for GeneWeaver. The project is research-focused, so timelines are flexible and exploratory.

---

## Phase I: Core Genome Abstractions (Implemented / Partial)
- Python-based genome scaffolding
- Early XNA-like base abstractions
- Initial sequence parsing and manipulation
- Basic population simulation prototypes

---

## Phase II: Molecular Logic & Bio-Inspired Computation (Experimental / In Progress)
- DNA strand displacement logic simulation
- Multi-layer decision circuits
- Reaction kinetics modeling
- Visualizing molecular logic outputs

---

## Phase III: Advanced Population Dynamics (Experimental / In Progress)
- Stochastic population simulations with mutation and selection
- Bottleneck and founder effects modeling
- Cross-linking with genome abstraction layer
- Visualization of allele frequency trends

---

## Phase IV: Conceptual Extensions / Planned
- CI/CD and automated testing pipelines (research-stage prototype)
- Docker and cloud-ready deployment concepts
- Extended molecular logic and AI integration
- Integration with real datasets for future validation
- Expanded visualization dashboard
