# GeneWeaver: Advanced Computational Framework for Synthetic Genomics

## 1. Project Overview
GeneWeaver is a high-performance bio-informatics suite developed for the simulation and architectural design of synthetic genetic systems. This framework integrates Xeno-Nucleic Acid (XNA) logic, stochastic population dynamics, and molecular-scale neural processing.

This project represents a **64-stage developmental lifecycle**, documenting the transition from raw genomic sequencing to the creation of autonomous synthetic genetic firewalls.

## 2. Core Architecture & Technical Modules

### 2.1 XNA-Genesis (Synthetic Genetic Firewall)
The xna_core.py module implements a synthetic encryption layer using non-canonical nucleobases (X, Y). 
* Encryption Logic: Mapping 8-bit digital data to 6-base synthetic genomic strings.
* Integrity Control: MD5-based checksums embedded within the sequence to detect point mutations.

### 2.2 Molecular Neural Logic (Bio-Neural Decision Making)
bio_neural.py simulates DNA Strand Displacement (DSD) cascades. This allows for computational logic (AND/OR/NOT) to be executed via molecular concentrations.

### 2.3 Stochastic Population Dynamics (Darwin-X)
population_dynamics.py utilizes Monte Carlo methods to model allele frequency shifts under varying selection pressures.

### 2.4 Cryo-EM Structural Reconstruction
cryo_em_recon_v3.py provides a simulation environment for 3D protein structure reconstruction from high-noise 2D projection data.

## 3. The 64-Step Engineering Roadmap
1. Phase I: Genomic Analysis (Steps 1-16)
2. Phase II: Synthetic Architecture (Steps 17-32)
