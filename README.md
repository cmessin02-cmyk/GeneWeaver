# GeneWeaver  
### A Research-Stage Computational Framework for Synthetic Genomics & Evolutionary Modeling

---

## 🔬 Overview

**GeneWeaver** is an open-source, research-stage computational framework designed to **explore, prototype, and simulate concepts in synthetic genomics, population genetics, and molecular computation**. The project focuses on building *in-silico* models that bridge theoretical genome design with evolutionary and environmental constraints, allowing experimentation before any wet-lab validation.

Rather than presenting a finished production system, GeneWeaver serves as a **conceptual and experimental platform** for investigating how engineered genetic constructs might behave under mutation, selection, environmental stress, and artificial design constraints such as non-canonical base systems.

The framework is written in **Python (3.9+)**, prioritizing clarity, modularity, and extensibility for future research expansion.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

GeneWeaver is built around the following research goals:

- Explore **synthetic and non-canonical genome representations** (e.g., XNA-like abstractions)
- Model **stochastic population dynamics** under evolutionary pressures
- Investigate **molecular-scale logic concepts** inspired by DNA strand displacement
- Provide a sandbox for **computational genomics experimentation**
- Encourage interdisciplinary thinking across biology, computation, and systems design

This project is intended for **learning, research exploration, and conceptual prototyping** rather than immediate real-world deployment.

---

## 🧬 Core Research Modules (Conceptual)

### 1. Genome Abstraction & Synthetic Bases
GeneWeaver introduces experimental genome representations that extend beyond canonical DNA bases (A, T, C, G). These abstractions are used to explore:

- Information encoding beyond natural biological constraints
- Mutation resistance and error-checking concepts
- Controlled genome transformations in simulations

> ⚠️ These models are **computational abstractions**, not claims of real biochemical synthesis.

---

### 2. Molecular Logic & Bio-Inspired Computation
The framework explores **bio-inspired logic systems** inspired by DNA strand displacement and molecular reaction cascades. These simulations investigate:

- Logic-gate-like behavior using sequence interactions
- Competition-based decision models (winner-take-all analogs)
- Signal propagation in constrained molecular environments

This work is **theoretical and exploratory**, aimed at understanding how computation might emerge at the molecular level.

---

### 3. Stochastic Population Dynamics
GeneWeaver includes early models for simulating **population-level genetic behavior**, incorporating:

- Genetic drift
- Mutation
- Selection pressure
- Population bottlenecks and founder effects

These simulations help explore how engineered or abstract genomes evolve over many generations under varying conditions.

---

## 🚧 Implementation Status

**Current State: Research & Prototyping**

### Implemented / Partially Implemented
- Python-based simulation scaffolding
- Early population dynamics models
- Experimental genome/XNA abstractions
- Modular code layout for future expansion

### Experimental / In Progress
- Molecular logic simulations
- Extended genome integrity checks
- Visualization of evolutionary trends

### Planned / Conceptual
- Expanded validation benchmarks
- Performance optimization
- Improved visualization dashboards
- Formal documentation of mathematical models

GeneWeaver is **actively evolving**, and many components are intentionally exploratory.

---

## 🧪 Intended Use Cases

GeneWeaver may be useful for:

- Students exploring **computational biology & bioinformatics**
- Researchers prototyping **genomic simulation ideas**
- Learning projects combining **biology, math, and programming**
- Conceptual groundwork for future synthetic biology research

It is **not** intended for clinical, industrial, or biosecurity deployment.

---

## 🧠 Mathematical & Computational Foundations

The framework draws inspiration from established principles such as:

- Stochastic processes (e.g., Wright–Fisher models)
- Hamming distance and error metrics
- Thermodynamic intuition for molecular interactions
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Basic kinetic modeling concepts

These models are simplified and adapted for computational experimentation rather than biological precision.
